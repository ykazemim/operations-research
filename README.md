# Operations Research — Pyomo Implementations

This repository contains my work for the *Operations Research* course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).
The course was instructed by **Dr. Farnaz Hooshmand**.

The notebooks here focus on modeling and solving optimization problems using **[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/)** in Python. Each notebook corresponds to a set of exercises from the course and includes both the problem formulation and its implementation.

## Contents  
  
* Modeling
* Linear Programming
* Cutting Stock Problem
* Transportation & Assignment Problem

---

## Usage

Each notebook is self-contained. You can either:

* Open the `.ipynb` files directly on an editor, or
* Run them interactively in **Google Colab** via the provided links (in text file).

---

## Notes

* These notebooks are educational material, reflecting exercises that I have completed during the course. They can be much improved and I would be glad receiving your suggestions.
